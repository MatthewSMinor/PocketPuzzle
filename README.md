# PocketPuzzle

This is a terminal/commandLine game where the user moves digits around a grid one by one to get all the numbers in order.

# What I learned

* This was excellent practice with 2-dimensional matricies

# How to play

* Put both the game.py and the functions.py files in the same folder on your PC.
* Open up the terminal of your choice
* Navigate to the folder where you saved the files
* If you are using command line then type game.py
* If you are using a terminal then you may need to type one of these variations
  * ./game.py
  * python3 game.py

Thanks to my *beautiful* wife Jessica for some rubber-ducky debugging.
